Update your app/layout.tsx to include PWA metadata and manifest reference### 4. Offline Support Implementation

Create an offline page for when users don't have network connectivity### 5. Service Worker Registration Component### 6. Install Prompt Component### 7. Offline Message Queue System

Implement offline message synchronization with IndexedDB and background sync### 8. Push Notification Implementation

Implement push notifications for employee messaging with service worker handling### 9. Custom Service Worker

Create a custom service worker to handle push events and background synchronization### 10. WebSocket Integration with Offline Support

Implement WebSocket management with reconnection strategies and offline queue integration## 🧪 Testing Your PWA Implementation

### 1. Local Testing Setup

Create a test environment configuration:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapid-public-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. PWA Audit Checklist

Use Chrome DevTools to verify PWA requirements:

Test service worker registration, manifest configuration, offline capabilities, and other PWA-specific requirements using Lighthouse and PWABuilder

**Chrome DevTools Testing:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Check:
   - ✅ Service Workers: Registered and active
   - ✅ Manifest: All icons loaded
   - ✅ Storage: IndexedDB contains offline data
   - ✅ Cache Storage: Resources cached properly

**Lighthouse Audit:**

1. Open DevTools → Lighthouse tab
2. Run PWA audit
3. Target scores:
   - Performance: 90+
   - PWA: 100
   - Accessibility: 95+

### 3. Offline Testing

Test offline functionality by simulating network conditions in DevTools

1. **Chrome DevTools:**
   - Network tab → Offline checkbox
   - Application → Service Workers → Offline

2. **Test scenarios:**
   - Navigate between cached pages
   - Send messages while offline
   - Access employee directory
   - Verify offline page displays correctly

### 4. Push Notification Testing

Test push notifications with proper permission handling and service worker events

```javascript
// Test push notification in console
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((registration) => {
  registration.showNotification("Test Notification", {
    body: "This is a test push notification",
    icon: "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
    badge: "/icons/badge-72x72.png",
    vibrate: [200, 100, 200],
    data: { testId: "123" },
  });
});
```

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Considerations

### iOS Safari Support

iOS requires specific handling for PWA installation and notifications

1. **Installation:** Manual "Add to Home Screen" process
2. **Push Notifications:** Limited support, requires user gesture
3. **Service Workers:** Full support in iOS 11.3+

### Android Chrome Features

1. **WebAPK:** Automatic generation for better integration
2. **Background Sync:** Full support
3. **Push Notifications:** Native-like experience

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### 1. Production Configuration

```javascript
// next.config.js (production)
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  dest: "public",
  disable: false, // Enable in production
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  buildExcludes: [/middleware-manifest\.json$/],
  publicExcludes: ["!robots.txt", "!sitemap.xml"],
});
```

### 2. HTTPS Requirements

- ✅ SSL certificate configured
- ✅ Force HTTPS redirect
- ✅ Update manifest start_url to HTTPS

### 3. Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Use WebP format
   - Implement responsive images
   - Lazy load employee photos

2. **Code Splitting:**
   - Dynamic imports for routes
   - Separate vendor bundles
   - Tree shake unused code

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Cache API responses strategically
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate
   - Set appropriate cache headers

## 🎯 Key Benefits for Your Use Case

### Employee Directory

- **Offline Access:** Browse employee data without network
- **Fast Search:** Cached data enables instant search
- **Photo Caching:** Employee photos available offline

### Messaging System

- **Offline Queue:** Messages sent when connection returns
- **Push Notifications:** Instant alerts for new messages
- **Background Sync:** Reliable message delivery

### User Experience
