# Claude + v0 Integrated Workflow

## Overview
This workflow combines v0's UI generation capabilities with Claude's coding abilities for seamless component creation and integration.

## How It Works

### 1. Generate UI with v0
```bash
npm run ui
```

This command will:
- Prompt you to describe the component you want
- Use v0 API to generate a beautiful, accessible component
- Automatically install required shadcn/ui dependencies
- Place the component in the correct directory
- Create an integration guide

### 2. Claude Takes Over
After v0 generates the component, Claude can:
- Integrate it into features and pages
- Add business logic and data fetching
- Connect it to your database
- Write tests
- Create API endpoints
- Build complete features around it

## Example Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Component
```bash
npm run ui
> Describe the UI component you want to create:
> Professional employee card with avatar, name, role, department, email, phone, and online status

> Component generated and integrated!
> üìÅ Component: src/components/employee-directory/EmployeeCard.tsx
```

### Step 2: Ask Claude to Use It
"Claude, create an employee listing page that uses the new EmployeeCard component with search and filtering"

Claude will then:
- Create a page component
- Add search functionality
- Implement filtering
- Connect to the database
- Add proper routing

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: v0 generates UI in seconds
2. **Quality**: Professional, accessible components
3. **Integration**: Claude seamlessly integrates components
4. **Consistency**: Follows your project patterns
5. **Collaboration**: v0 and Claude work together

## Component Organization

Components are automatically organized:
- `employee-directory/` - Employee-related UI
- `messaging/` - Chat and messaging UI
- `layout/` - Navigation and layout components
- `shared/` - Reusable components

## Tips

1. Be specific in your descriptions to v0
2. Let v0 handle the UI design
3. Let Claude handle the logic and integration
4. Review generated components before production use
5. Components include TypeScript types and accessibility

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Generation
Generate multiple related components:
1. Run `npm run ui` for each component
2. Ask Claude to create a feature using all of them

### Component Variants
After generation, ask Claude to:
- Create loading states
- Add dark mode support
- Create mobile variants
- Add animations

### Testing
Claude can automatically:
- Write component tests
- Add integration tests
- Create Storybook stories
- Test accessibility

This integrated workflow maximizes both v0's design capabilities and Claude's development skills!
